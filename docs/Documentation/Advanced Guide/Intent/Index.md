# Intent (Service Abstraction)

## What is Intent?

Intent helps the server by standardizing the INPUT and OUTPUT of common services.  

For example, getting an email is a common intent for all email services. 

Instead of the server calling the email services with different inputs and outputs, the services can adopt the intentâ€™s input and output to standardize the call for the servers.

## Configuring the Intent

### Create a new Intent

### Define the input and output

&lt;aside&gt;
ðŸ’¡ Behind the scene, [JSON Schema](../https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) used to perform the input and output validation

&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;aside&gt;
ðŸ’¡ Arguments are the keys for the [JSON Schema](../https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) properties
For example, for the below JSON, username and password are the arguments

```json
    "username_intent": { "type": "string" },
    "password_intent": { "type": "string" },
```

&lt;/aside&gt;

## Applying actions between mapping

### Method 1:  Select **Execution Action** from the **Data Element** popup

This is used to directly apply the action between the mapping

![Untitled](Untitled%208.png)

Select an action

![Untitled](Untitled%209.png)

Apply the action

### Method 2:  Click on the Action button

This is used to create an action that can be used during the mapping.

For example, making a database query and making the data available for use during the mapping.

Store the value in the **variable** scope for use
