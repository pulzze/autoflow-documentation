# Capture

API AutoFlow provides a convenient way to capture the incoming data to the server endpoints and service operations.

Typically, a developer would insert code to print logs to capture, view, and check the data being received by each operation. For example, when the frontend developer makes a request to one of the server endpoints (operation), the backend developer captures the data to assess the format and associated fields to work with.

API AutoFlow's simulation feature allows developers to capture data and use it throughout the workflow. This makes it easy to add actions that achieve the operation's functions.

## Capturing the incoming data
The capture feature can be turn on/off from the server and service operation.

A complete list of all captured data can be found in the Settings section.



### Capture All Operations

By turning on the toggle button, all the operations in both the server and service will be captured.

**WARNING!**  Capturing all the data can be extremely compute intensive.
