# Scope

A scope is a namespace for variables.  

:::tip Analogy
You can think of scopes as a filing cabinet. üóÑÔ∏è

Just like a cabinet draw that houses certain set of information, API AutoFlow has scopes to house certain set of data
:::

## Server scopes
In the case of HTTP, you have a request scope which includes the original request. You also have a variables scope which is free for you to store whatever values you want.


## Action Scopes
Actions have an output field where you can define where you would like to store their results for later use, by default it uses the key: output.

## Iteration Scope
Iteration action scope exists only inside the iteration action.  Iteration scope can not be accessed after the iteration is complete.
