# Data Simulation

Data simulation is a mock HTTP request data simulated for the purpose of testing a server, service during development. By simulating the data, developers can visualize the expected response as the actions are applied.

## From Operations

The data can be simulated from both server and service operations.

### Simulation button

The simulation button appears when the three dots at the end of the operation are clicked.

<div class="myResponsiveImg">
    <img src={SimulationButton} alt="Simulation Button" class="myResponsiveImg"/>
</div>

### Simulation section

Once simulated, a simulation section will appear on the right pane.

<div class="myResponsiveImg">
    <img src={SimulationSection} alt="Simulation Section" class="myResponsiveImg"/>
</div>

- Use the thunder icon to run the simulations.
- Use the Add button to create more simulations when multiple mock data are required for testing.

### Color indication

Notice that when the test goes through successfully, the actions and response will turn green. However, when any part of the operation fails, it will indicate in red.

### Trace

The trace shows the data at a certain state as it passes through the chain of actions.

<div class="myResponsiveImg">
    <img src={Trace} alt="Trace" class="myResponsiveImg"/>
</div>

### Actionâ€™s Data

When the trace button is clicked, the trace result appears on the right-bottom pane.

<div class="myResponsiveImg">
    <img src={ActionData} alt="Action's Data" class="myResponsiveImg"/>
</div>

### Result

The resulting data of the action.

### Data

The data that the action has received.
