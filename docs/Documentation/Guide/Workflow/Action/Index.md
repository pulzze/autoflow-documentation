Actions as the name implies are the actions you want to take.  For example, actions that perform  database/operation ,    string/trim  ,   condition/if   and  iteration/filter .  API AutoFlow provides a few hundred action(s) to build the operations and automation as simple as you want or as complex as you need.  You simply daisy chain the actions to create the outcome you need. 

Details about each action are located in the [Actions](../../../actions-library) section of the manual.
