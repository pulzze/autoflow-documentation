# Service (Workflow Abstraction)

## What is a Service?

- A service helps the server by taking out commonly used actions into a reusable group.
- A service performs set of operations and itsâ€™ [action](../https://www.notion.so/Actions-1645af0f140945e89931d7a261a30437)s.
- A service has an INPUT and an OUTPUT similar to functions in a programming language.

For example, a service to get email from a GMAIL API can be reused by many servers, where the service has multiple actions to accomplish the get email task.

## Configuring a Service

### Create a new Service

### Define the input and output

&lt;aside&gt;
ðŸ’¡ Behind the scene, [JSON Schema](../https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) used to perform the input and output validation

&lt;/aside&gt;

Create Input and Output arguments

&lt;aside&gt;
ðŸ’¡ Arguments are the keys for the [JSON Schema](../https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) properties
For example, for the below JSON, username and password are the arguments

```json
    "username": { "type": "string" },
    "password": { "type": "string" },
```

&lt;/aside&gt;

### Add Actions

Refer to Actions section on how to use Actions

### Map the Actionâ€™s output with the Service operation output

&lt;aside&gt;
ðŸ’¡ The data stored in the scope **variable** path *output* is being mapped to the serviceâ€™s output parameter **name_filtered**

&lt;/aside&gt;
