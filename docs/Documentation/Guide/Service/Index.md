# Service (Workflow Abstraction)

## What is a Service?

- A service helps the server by taking out commonly used actions into a reusable group.
- A service performs a set of operations and itsâ€™ [action](../../actions-library)s.
- A service has an INPUT and an OUTPUT similar to functions in a programming language.

For example, a service to get email from a GMAIL API can be reused by many servers, where the service has multiple actions to accomplish the get email task.

## Configuring a Service

### Create a new Service

<div class="myResponsiveImg">

</div>

### Create an ID for the Service

<div class="myResponsiveImg">

</div>

### Add a new operation

</div>

### Define the input and output

ðŸ’¡ Behind the scene, [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) is used to perform the input and output validation.

</div>

### Create Input and Output arguments

</div>


ðŸ’¡ Arguments are the keys for the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) properties. For example, for the below JSON, username and password are the arguments:

```json
    "username": { "type": "string" },
    "password": { "type": "string" },
```


### Add Actions
Refer to the Actions section on how to use Actions.

### Map the Actionâ€™s output with the Service operation output

</div>

ðŸ’¡ The data stored in the scope variable path output is being mapped to the serviceâ€™s output
