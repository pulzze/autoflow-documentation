# Clients

## What is a Client?

**Clients** are connectors to the database and other systems.  For example, API AutoFlow provides a connector to popular databases such as Maria DB, MS SQL, Oracle, and more.

By configuring the connection with the database credentials and the server information, you can issue any SQL commands to work directly with the database.
