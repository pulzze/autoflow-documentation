# CI/CD

Implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for API AutoFlow requires automating the processes of building, testing, and deploying API AutoFlow configuration changes along with application code changes. The CI/CD process for configuration-based products, like API AutoFlow, shares many similarities with schema-based products, such as databases. Both are managed alongside application code, and are tested and deployed on their respective products.

Here is an overview of how to achieve CI/CD for API AutoFlow:

1. **Version Control:** Use API AutoFlow's versioning feature to track history and collaborate with team members.  Make sure your team agrees on a versioning format.
2. **Build Automation:** Store your configuration, files, and other artifacts in a version control system (VCS) such as Git. This allows you to track changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain a history of modifications.
3. **API Testing:** Develop a suite of automated tests to verify the correctness and stability of API changes. This includes tests for validating configuration modifications, checking endpoint integrity, and testing any associated business logic. Tools like Postman can be useful for executing API tests.
4. **Integration Testing:** Incorporate API tests into your overall application's integration testing framework. This ensures that API changes are tested alongside application code changes to identify any potential issues that may arise due to interactions between the two.
5. **Continuous Deployment:** Automate the process of deploying configuration changes to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production). This can be achieved by leveraging deployment tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or Azure DevOps pipelines. These tools can execute the necessary scripts to apply configurations as part of the deployment pipeline.
6. **Environment Management:** Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) techniques to define and provision API server environments in a consistent and repeatable manner. Tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation can help automate the creation and configuration of API server instances or containers.
7. **Monitoring and Rollbacks:** Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the performance and health of your API servers. This ensures that any issues are quickly identified and can trigger a rollback if necessary. Additionally, establish processes for rolling back configuration changes in case of critical failures or issues in production.
8. **Continuous Improvement:** Continuously monitor and analyze the CI/CD process for API servers, identifying areas for improvement and addressing any bottlenecks. Collect feedback from the team and stakeholders to refine the process and make it more efficient and reliable over time.

 

The CI/CD process for configuration or schema-based products may seem different to developers who have only used code-based CI/CD. However, configuration and schema products are becoming an integral part of the development lifecycle and are increasingly managed by development teams.
