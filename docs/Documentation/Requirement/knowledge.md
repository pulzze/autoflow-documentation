## 1. Workflow

A workflow is a common feature among iPaaS platforms for users to create the automation, logic, and data transformation.

A workflow typically starts with a trigger (INPUT) and provides a result (OUTPUT).

:::note Reference
Refer to [Workflow](../Guide/Workflow/) page to learn more about how to use workflow.

### âœ… Key point 1: Input and Output

Workflows have Input and Output. 

Depending on where workflow is used, the INPUT and OUTPUT may be different.

#### Server

HTTP server has request and response. Refer to [Server](../Guide/Server/) page to learn more about HTTP Server.

|             |             |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **INPUT**   | HTTP Request |
| **OUTPUT**  | HTTP Response |


#### Service

Service is like a function in programming with INPUT and OUTPUT arguments. Refer to [Service](../Guide/Service/) page to learn more about Service.

|             |             |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **INPUT**   | INPUT Argument(s) |
| **OUTPUT**  | OUTPUT Argument(S) |



### âœ… Key point 2: INPUT Simulation

[INPUT Simulation](../Guide/Workflow/Data-Simulation/)



### âœ… Key point 3: Actions, Scopes and variables

[Scope](../../Guide/Workflow/Scope) is where data (variables) get stored and accessed in different parts of the workflow.


### âœ… Key point 4: OUTPUT Mapping

[OUTPUT Mapping](../Guide/Workflow/Output-Mapping/)






1. [API](../../Guide/API/) to define your endpoints
2. [Server](../../Guide/Server/) to host HTTP(S) for each endpoint
3. [Service](../../Guide/Service/) is like a reusable function in programming
4. [Client](../../Guide/Clients/) is a connection to systems such as database


### Where to find the features

Refer to [Layout](../Layout/) for more details

## Commons steps when creating a new solution

1. Create API endpoint
2. Create a server for the API endpoint
3. Join actions in workflow

- If you want to create a reusable function

4. Create a service that you an call from any workflow

- Need to use database or other clients?

5. Create a client to connect with database
