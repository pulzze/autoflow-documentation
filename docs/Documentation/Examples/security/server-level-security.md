# Server Level Security

There are 2 forms of server security that may be enabled using API AutoFlow.

## TLS  (HTTPS)

Learn more about [TLS configuration](../../../Documentation/Guide/Server/Info/tls)

Server may be configured to use TLS by configuring required information, such as adding certificates.

## Authorization validation

Whether it is Basic or Bearer, API security may be configured using the security tab of the server configuration to validate the username/password or token information included in each request.
