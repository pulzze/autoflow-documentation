# 1 to N

Received data from a single source such as log in a string format and split the records into an array of entries.

## Data Objective

In this example, syslog from Cisco ASA 302013 firewall which is in a string format is normalized into a standardized JSON format.

:::info Process
1. The process will be to split the string on each line to create an array of records.
2. Than apply various actions to extract the value(s).
:::

## Transforming the data

1. First to split the log on a new line, us the action [string/split-newline](Documentation/actions-library/data/string/action-string-split-by-newline.mdx).
2. Second, loop over the records using the action [iteration/map](Documentation/actions-library/flow/iteration/action-iteration-map.mdx).


<img src={img_1to_n_explanation_min} alt="1 to N explanation" class="myResponsiveImg" width="800px"/>

:::tip
Actions can be applied flexibly to work on any form of data.
:::

## Working on each record

The objective is to extract the IP address and Port number. To do that, we can look for patterns **TCP connection** and **OUTSIDE:**. Then select the value that follows those patterns.

```
%ASA-6-302013: TCP connection 933 OUTSIDE:172.217.169.68
```

Similar to how the earlier [string/split-newline](Documentation/actions-library/data/string/action-string-split-by-newline.mdx) action was used to split the string by a new line;

An action to split the string by pattern called [string/split-by](Documentation/actions-library/data/string/action-string-split-by.mdx) can be used to further isolate the value.  

<img src={img_1to_n_explanation_1} alt="1 to N explanation" class="myResponsiveImg" width="800px"/>

Finally using **Return**, put the data in the desired standardized JSON object format.
