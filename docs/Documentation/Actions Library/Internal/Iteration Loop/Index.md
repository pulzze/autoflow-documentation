# Iteration Loop

The iteration actions are like loop in programing language. It iterates over each value in the array and executes flow of actions that are place inside.

When configuring iterations, you are have to work with index and value of the array. When you turn on the dev mode, you have access to the first(index 0) value from the array as a sample to work with.

There are many types of iteration actions to choose from. Below is a table of their purpose, pros, and cons

|  | Purpose | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All are True | Tests array to see if all are true | Fast | Does not extract value, Does not change data |
| Any is True | Tests array to see if any is true | Fast | Does not extract value, Does not change data |
| Filter | Filter elements | Fast | Does not extract value, Does not change data |
| Find Index |  |  |  |
| Find Value |  |  |  |
| Find |  |  |  |
| For Each | Extract value & take action | Can extract value | Can be slow |
| Map | Apply change to original data | Can change original Data | Does not extract value, Does not filter data |
| While |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
