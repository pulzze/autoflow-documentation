### Key concepts
          
1. [API](../../Guide/API/) to define your endpoints
2. [Server](../../Guide/Server/) to host HTTP(S) for each endpoint
3. [Service](../../Guide/Service/) is like a reusable function in programming
4. [Client](../../Guide/Clients/) is a connection to systems such as database
5. [Workflow](../../Guide/Workflow/) is where the automation and data transformation happens<br />- [Scope](../../Guide/Workflow/Scope) is where data (variables) get stored and accessed in different parts of the workflow.

## Commons steps when creating a new solution

1. Create API endpoint
2. Create a server for the API endpoint
3. Join actions in workflow

- If you want to create a reusable function

4. Create a service that you an call from any workflow

- Need to use database or other clients?

5. Create a client to connect with database
